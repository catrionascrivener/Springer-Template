To submit this to Springer you need to:

Upload the .tex file and mark it as 'manuscript'
Upload all of the additional files from the Springer template folder (spbasic.bst,                spmpsci.bst...etc) separately and mark them all as 'manuscript'

Upload the .eps or .pdf image files (whichever you reference in your manuscript) and mark them as 'figure'

These packages should be in the preamble:
%   \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} 
%   \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

Use this document class for natbib style citations:
%   \documentclass[natbib]{svjour3}      

Instead of using the normal \bibliography{bibFileName}, insert your bibilography items into
  the main .tex file. You can copy and paste these from the .bbl file that is created when you
  compile in overleaf. To access this file, click on 'logs and output' (next to the recompile button); at the bottom of the screen click on 'other logs and files'; then select 'bbl file'. Copy and past the contents of this file into your main .tex file, before end{document}.
Note the you will need to begin{thebibliography} before the items, and end{thebibliography}.

Important!! Make sure that your bib entries do not use any unusual characters. Use the format \"o \`a etc. for special letters.
