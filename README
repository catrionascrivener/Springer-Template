# Springer template

Here you will find the template for a journal article submission to Springer journals. 
Although Springer provides a template, I still had multiple issues getting it to compile on their system.
This edited template should remove these issues.

Within this folder you will find a .tex file called 'SubmittingToSpringer.tex'. 
More details on how to get your submission to compile correctly can be found here.

For more info on using Overleaf and LaTeX, please see my other templates available on Github.
